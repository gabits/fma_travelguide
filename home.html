                        Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of
                        Barcelona.
                        After merging with the Kingdom of Aragon, Barcelona continued to be an important city in the
                        Crown of
                        Aragon as an economic and administrative centre of this Crown and the capital of the
                        Principality of
                        Catalonia. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and
                        a major
                        tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís
                        Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The headquarters of
                        the
                        Union for the Mediterranean is located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992
                        Summer
                        Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions and also many international sport
                        tournaments.
