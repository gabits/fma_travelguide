                    <h3>Two Words: Tapas and Sangria</h3>

                    <p>
                        Barcelona is known for its <b>amazing food</b> and the best way to sample it is by ordering
                        plenty of tapas and washing them all down with a <i>cool, refreshing glass of red or white
                        sangria</i>. There are tons of little cafés and restaurants all along the beach at <b>Barceloneta</b>
                        and on all sides of <b>La Rambla</b>, and plenty of daily deals to be had.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right around the corner from La Sagrada Família, there's a cute little place called <b>El Tastet
                        de L'Artur</b> that has a set tapas lunch menu for € 15 per person. The tapas just keep coming
                        and sangria is included! While you're in Barcelona, make sure you try the <i>seafood paella</i>,
                        another popular and delicious dish. If you're spending time at the beach along Barceloneta, stop
                        by <i>Tapa Tapa</i>, a great spot for a <b>tapas-filled dinner</b> right along the water.

                    <h3>The metro is your friend</h3>

                    <p>If you're going to be making a bunch of trips on the city's metro, it's better to <b>purchase the
                        10-trip pass</b> and you and your friends can work your way through them for up to 10 trips for
                        about <b>10 euros</b>. The Barcelona <i>metro is pretty easy to navigate</i>, and reaches just
                        about everything you'll want to see, often leaving you within a short walk of whatever you're
                        trying to find. If you're going to be out late, please be aware that <b>parts of the metro do
                            shut down after midnight</b>. At the end, you might be able to split a cab or Uber, but it
                        can be pretty surprising when you're in a new place and plans change suddenly.

                    <h3>A word about safety</h3>

                    <p>
                        Anywhere you travel in the world you should be wary of purse-snatchers and pickpockets,
                        especially in tourist hotspots like La Rambla. Keep a close eye on your personal belongings,
                        especially fancy phones and cameras, and whenever you leave the city's various bars
                        and clubs at night.

                    <h3>Stay in the center of town — for less</h3>

                    <p>
                        You don't necessarily have to spend a fortune to have a great vacation in Barca—stick to
                        fail-safes like Airbnb to stay within local neighborhoods in an <b>apartment rental at
                        reasonable prices</b>. The <i>metro system</i> in Barcelona is so <i>extensive</i> you can even
                        stay in the suburbs and take the trains back and forth. If you're deadset on staying in the city
                        center, another affordable option are <b>hostels</b>, which usually have good quality standards
                        and low to medium prices according to what type of room you'd like to stay in.

                    <h3>Always book your tickets online ahead of time</h3>

                    <p>
                        If you're planning to see the three big Gaudí sites — La Sagrada Família, Park Güell, and La
                        Pedrera at Casa Milà — make sure you book your tickets online ahead of time to avoid being
                        locked out of something you came all the way to Barcelona to see. As an extra perk, you'll get
                        to <b>skip the long lines by planning ahead</b>. Parc Guëll, for example, <i>only allows a
                        certain number of people in each day</i> and gives you a <i>specific time to enter</i>, but is
                        well worth visiting.
